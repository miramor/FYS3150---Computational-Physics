 * NB!! - Have to make a directoary named: ResultsComputation
 * This directoary stores all the results.
 *
 * First set the relevant paramaters. To make use of visualize.py its reccomended
 * to run the program twice, once where we useSpecial = true and then = false.
 * Repeat variable determines how many times we wanna solve the problem to find
 * a better estimate of time, minimize external factors.
 *
 * First part uses thomas algorithm which allows n to exceeed 1e4.
 * Writes the time results to a file.
 *
 * Second part uses LU and solves using SolveLU and writes the relevant
 * information to 2 files the results and the CPUtime.

 * If already ran LU part once, you can comment this part out.
