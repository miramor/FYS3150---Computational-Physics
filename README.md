# FYS3150
Repository of collaborative coursework for FYS3150-Computational Physics at the University of Oslo. The course covers methods for numerically solving a wide range of mathematical problems in physics.
There are a total of five projects, which are outlined below. Each project folder contains the source code and a report.

## Projects
### [Project 1](https://github.com/miramor/FYS3150---Computational-Physics/tree/master/Project1):
Thomas algorithm and LU decomposition to solve a second order differential equation. 

### [Project 2](https://github.com/miramor/FYS3150---Computational-Physics/tree/master/Project2):
Recasting second order differential equations into matrix equations to solve the 
given eigenvalue problems with the Jacobi algorithm.




### [Project 3](https://github.com/miramor/FYS3150---Computational-Physics/tree/master/Project3):
Simulation of the solar system by solving coupled ordinary differential equations.

### [Project 4](https://github.com/miramor/FYS3150---Computational-Physics/tree/master/Project4):
Studies of phase transitions in magnetic systems;
Conducting Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D Ising model using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to generate samples.



### [Project 5](https://github.com/miramor/FYS3150---Computational-Physics/tree/master/Project5):
Numerical Studies of the SIRS model (disease);
Use of both the fourth-order runge-kutta method (RK4) and monte-carlo sampling (MC) to simulate how a disease would spread among an isolated population consisting of three groups (states): susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R).
